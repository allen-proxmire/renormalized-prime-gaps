# Renormalized Prime Gap Studies

This repository contains two empirical papers investigating the statistical
structure of prime gaps after logarithmic renormalization.

The papers focus exclusively on data-driven analysis and null-model comparison,
without assuming any underlying dynamical or theoretical explanation.

## Papers

**Paper I: Scale–Stable Statistics of Renormalized Prime Gaps**

This paper establishes that the renormalized prime gap sequence  
\( g_n / \log p_n \) exhibits approximate scale invariance and local stationarity
across wide ranges of primes. It provides a statistical baseline for subsequent
higher-order analysis.

**Paper II: Local Correlation Structure in Renormalized Prime Gaps**

Building on Paper I, this paper examines whether consecutive renormalized gaps
are statistically independent. Using geometric diagnostics, principal component
analysis, and multiple null models, it demonstrates the presence of short-range,
scale-stable correlation structure with a finite correlation length.

## Notes

- The two papers are independent but complementary.
- No theoretical model or mechanism is assumed.
- All claims are supported by direct computation and null-model comparison.
